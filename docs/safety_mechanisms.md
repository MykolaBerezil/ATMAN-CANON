> # Safety Mechanisms in ATMAN-CANON
> 
> ## 1. Philosophy: Safety by Design
> 
> In the ATMAN-CANON framework, safety is not an add-on or a patch. It is a core principle that is woven into the fabric of the architecture. The goal is to create AI systems that are inherently stable, bounded, and predictable, even when dealing with complex, uncertain, and potentially chaotic environments. This is achieved through a combination of theoretical concepts and practical implementations.
> 
> ## 2. Renormalization Safety
> 
> **Concept:** Inspired by renormalization groups in physics, this mechanism is designed to prevent runaway feedback loops and unbounded growth in the system's internal states. It works by monitoring the "energy" of the reasoning system—a measure of its complexity, confidence, and recursion depth. If the energy exceeds a certain threshold, a renormalization process is applied to bring the system back to a safe operating range.
> 
> **Implementation:** The `RenormalizationSafety` class in `atman_core.utils.safety` provides the following functionalities:
> 
> - **Energy Calculation:** Continuously calculates the system's energy based on factors like confidence levels, feature magnitudes, and recursion depth.
> - **Standard Renormalization:** If the energy is too high, it applies a scaling factor to dampen the system's state.
> - **Emergency Renormalization:** If divergence is detected (a rapid, uncontrolled increase in energy), it triggers an emergency reset to a known safe state.
> 
> ## 3. κ-Block Logic
> 
> **Concept:** The κ-Block (Kappa-Block) Logic is a formal system designed to ensure logical consistency and coherence in the framework's reasoning. It treats chains of reasoning as "logical blocks" that must satisfy a certain level of internal consistency, defined by the κ-threshold.
> 
> **Implementation:** The `KappaBlockLogic` class in `atman_core.utils.safety` allows you to:
> 
> - **Create Logical Blocks:** Construct blocks of reasoning from a set of premises.
> - **Validate Consistency:** Check if a logical block meets the κ-threshold for consistency.
> - **Detect Contradictions:** Automatically identify and flag contradictions within a chain of reasoning.
> 
> ## 4. SafetyBounds
> 
> The `SafetyBounds` dataclass provides a centralized way to configure the various safety parameters of the framework. This includes:
> 
> - `min_confidence` and `max_confidence`: The allowable range for belief confidence.
> - `max_recursion_depth`: The maximum depth for recursive reasoning.
> - `energy_threshold`: The energy level at which renormalization is triggered.
> - `divergence_threshold`: The threshold for detecting system divergence.
> 
> ## 5. Usage Example
> 
> ```python
> from atman_core.utils import RenormalizationSafety, SafetyBounds
> 
> # Define custom safety bounds
> custom_bounds = SafetyBounds(max_recursion_depth=5, energy_threshold=500.0)
> 
> # Initialize the safety mechanism
> safety = RenormalizationSafety(bounds=custom_bounds)
> 
> # A dangerous, high-energy state
> dangerous_state = {
>     'confidence': 0.999,
>     'recursion_depth': 10,
>     'features': {'value': 1000.0}
> }
> 
> # Apply renormalization
> safe_state = safety.apply_renormalization(dangerous_state)
> 
> print(f"Original Confidence: {dangerous_state['confidence']}")
> print(f"Renormalized Confidence: {safe_state['confidence']:.3f}")
> ```
