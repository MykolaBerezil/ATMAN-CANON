> # The RBMK Framework
> 
> ## 1. Overview
> 
> The **Recursive Bayesian Meta-Knowledge (RBMK)** framework is the core reasoning engine of ATMAN-CANON. It is a novel architecture designed to handle uncertainty, recursive reasoning, and meta-cognitive processes. The RBMK framework allows the system to not only reason about the world but also to reason about its own knowledge and reasoning processes.
> 
> This is achieved by representing all knowledge as probabilistic beliefs and continuously updating these beliefs as new evidence becomes available. The "meta-knowledge" aspect comes from the framework's ability to model the uncertainty and reliability of its own beliefs, creating a hierarchical and self-referential knowledge structure.
> 
> ## 2. How It Works
> 
> The RBMK framework processes information in a multi-stage pipeline:
> 
> 1.  **Belief Update:** When new evidence is received, the framework uses a Bayesian inference engine to update the system's belief network. This involves adjusting the probabilities of various hypotheses based on the new data.
> 
> 2.  **Meta-Reasoning:** After the belief update, a meta-reasoning engine analyzes the changes in the belief network. It assesses the impact of the new evidence, identifies potential conflicts, and evaluates the overall confidence of the system's beliefs.
> 
> 3.  **Invariant Detection:** The framework continuously searches for invariant patterns in the data and its own reasoning processes. These invariants represent stable, reliable knowledge that can be used to constrain future reasoning.
> 
- **Uncertainty Propagation:** The uncertainty associated with each piece of evidence and each belief is rigorously propagated throughout the system. This ensures that the system always maintains an accurate representation of its own ignorance.
> 
> 5.  **Recursive Reasoning:** If the level of uncertainty or conflict is too high, the framework can trigger a recursive reasoning process. It essentially "steps back" and re-evaluates its own conclusions, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of the problem.
> 
> ## 3. Key Classes
> 
> The RBMK framework is implemented in the `atman_core.core.rbmk` module and consists of several key classes:
> 
> - `RBMKFramework`: The main class that orchestrates the entire reasoning process.
> - `BayesianInferenceEngine`: Handles the core Bayesian belief updates.
> - `MetaReasoningEngine`: Performs meta-cognitive analysis of the reasoning process.
> - `RBMKInvariantDetector`: Detects invariants within the RBMK framework.
> - `UncertaintyPropagator`: Manages the propagation of uncertainty through the belief network.
> 
> ## 4. Usage Example
> 
> ```python
> from atman_core import RBMKFramework
> 
> # Initialize the RBMK framework
> reasoner = RBMKFramework(max_recursion_depth=5)
> 
> # Create a knowledge item (evidence)
> knowledge_item = {
>     'id': 'E001',
>     'domain': 'medical',
>     'data': {'symptoms': ['fever', 'cough']},
>     'confidence': 0.85,
>     'conclusion': 'patient shows signs of respiratory infection'
> }
> 
> # Process the knowledge item
> result = reasoner.process_knowledge_item(knowledge_item)
> 
> # Analyze the result
> print(f"Final Confidence: {result['final_confidence']:.3f}")
> print(f"Generated {len(result.get('belief_update', {}).get('hypotheses', []))} hypotheses")
> ```
